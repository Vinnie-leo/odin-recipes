    <img src="../images/chicken.jpg" style="width:400px">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups sweet barbeque sauce </li>
        <li>1 cup Italian salad dressing</li>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) bone-in chicken legs with skin</li>
        <li>hickory wood chips as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix barbecue sauce and salad dressing together.</li>
        <li>Put chicken legs in a large zip-top bag and pour sauce 
            all over them. Squeeze out the excess air and seal the bag. 
            Massage marinade into the chicken a bit, 
            then refrigerate for 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the refrigerator; 
            set bag on the counter and bring to room temperature, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat and lightly oil the grate. 
            Load a smoker box with wood chips and set on the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the bag and transfer to the preheated grill. 
            Cover and cook for 10 minutes, then flip, basting both sides with the 
            remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook (with the lid closed and listening for flare-ups) 
            until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 
            about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near 
            the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken to a platter and tent with foil. Let rest for 5 minutes before 
            serving.</li>

    </ol>
